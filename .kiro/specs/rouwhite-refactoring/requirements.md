# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring the RouWhite Flutter application to improve code architecture, maintainability, performance, and user experience. The refactoring will transform the current monolithic structure into a clean, scalable architecture following Flutter best practices while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clean Architecture Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow Clean Architecture principles, so that the code is maintainable, testable, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is reorganized THEN the system SHALL have separate layers for presentation, domain, and data
2. WHEN business logic is separated from UI THEN the system SHALL have clear boundaries between layers
3. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL follow dependency inversion principle
4. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL support easy extension without modifying existing code

### Requirement 2: State Management Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent state management throughout the app, so that data flow is predictable and debugging is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL use Provider pattern for state management
2. WHEN data changes THEN the system SHALL notify only relevant widgets to rebuild
3. WHEN app state is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide a single source of truth
4. WHEN errors occur in state management THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 3: Data Persistence Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my favorites and preferences to be saved, so that I don't lose my data when I close and reopen the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user adds a route to favorites THEN the system SHALL persist the data locally
2. WHEN user reopens the app THEN the system SHALL restore previously saved favorites
3. WHEN user modifies preferences THEN the system SHALL save changes immediately
4. WHEN local storage fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and graceful error handling, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show specific field-level errors
3. WHEN unexpected errors happen THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging
4. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to be fast and responsive, so that I can quickly access route information without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN widgets are built THEN the system SHALL use const constructors where possible
2. WHEN lists are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement efficient scrolling with lazy loading
3. WHEN maps are rendered THEN the system SHALL optimize marker and polyline rendering
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL minimize rebuild operations

### Requirement 6: Type Safety and Data Models

**User Story:** As a developer, I want strongly typed data models, so that I can catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL use typed models instead of Map<String, dynamic>
2. WHEN API responses are handled THEN the system SHALL have proper JSON serialization
3. WHEN data validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use type-safe validation methods
4. WHEN null values are possible THEN the system SHALL handle null safety properly

### Requirement 7: Modular Widget Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable and maintainable widgets, so that I can easily modify UI components without affecting other parts of the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large widgets exist THEN the system SHALL break them into smaller, focused components
2. WHEN widgets are reused THEN the system SHALL provide configurable parameters
3. WHEN UI changes are needed THEN the system SHALL allow modifications without breaking other components
4. WHEN widgets are complex THEN the system SHALL separate business logic from presentation logic

### Requirement 8: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL have unit tests covering core functionality
2. WHEN widgets are created THEN the system SHALL have widget tests for UI components
3. WHEN user flows are defined THEN the system SHALL have integration tests for critical paths
4. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback on test results

### Requirement 9: API Integration Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper API integration layer, so that the app can easily connect to real backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated service layer
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and timeout handling
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL properly parse and validate data
4. WHEN offline mode is needed THEN the system SHALL cache essential data locally

### Requirement 10: Code Quality and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-documented and linted code, so that the codebase is easy to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL follow Dart/Flutter linting rules
2. WHEN complex logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive comments
3. WHEN public APIs are created THEN the system SHALL have proper documentation
4. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL pass all static analysis checks
