# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Analyze and correct Ruta 1 coordinates

  - Study the official map provided for Ruta 1 - La Paz/Campanario/Pomona/Chirimía
  - Update the stops array with corrected GPS coordinates that match the real route
  - Ensure the route passes through Centro (Parque Caldas area) as shown in the map
  - Verify that the corrected coordinates follow actual streets in Popayán
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 2. Research and implement TP2BT route

  - Investigate if TP2BT is an existing route or needs to be created
  - Extract coordinates from the official TP2BT map provided
  - Create or update the route with correct stops for Tomas C./Chirimía/Craó/Campanario/Jardines De Paz
  - Verify that all neighborhood names are correct and exist in Popayán
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Validate coordinate accuracy

  - Implement coordinate validation to ensure all GPS points are within Popayán city bounds
  - Cross-reference coordinates with real street locations using mapping services
  - Verify that the sequence of stops follows a logical geographical path
  - Test that coordinates correspond to accessible bus stop locations
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 4. Update route distances and timing

  - Recalculate route distances using the corrected coordinates and Haversine formula
  - Update estimated travel times based on real route lengths and urban traffic patterns
  - Ensure distance and time calculations are consistent across all corrected routes
  - Verify that calculated values are realistic for Popayán bus routes
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Update neighborhood and stop information

  - Verify that all neighborhoods listed in the routes actually exist and are correctly spelled
  - Add any missing neighborhoods that the corrected routes pass through
  - Ensure that the neighborhoods list matches the actual geographical path of the route
  - Update route descriptions to reflect the corrected paths
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 2.3, 1.3_

- [x] 6. Test route corrections in map display




  - Verify that corrected routes display properly in MapaRutaPagina
  - Test that route lines follow logical paths on the map
  - Ensure that bus stops appear at correct locations
  - Validate that route colors and styling work correctly with updated data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 7. Verify data consistency and integration
  - Test that all route data loads correctly in RutasPagina
  - Verify that navigation to map pages works with corrected route data
  - Ensure that route search and filtering functions work with updated information
  - Test that favorites functionality works correctly with corrected routes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.3, 4.1_
